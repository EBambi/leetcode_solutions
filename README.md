# Leetcode Solutions 👨‍💻

## Intro

Hey there!

If you found this repo you were probably looking for a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) solution or just found my profile and somehow ended up here, either way just to clarify I solve these problems for **fun** so don't expect my solutions to be the more eficient, I'm trying to get to that level of not needing to google the solution because once I sumbitted my code the runtime graph shows my solution in the middle or at the end of the graph 😅, but anyways still in process of achive that.

## Repo Structure

This repo follows a simple structure of having a folder per problem I'm able to solve in Leetcode ([If you want to take a peek to my profile](https://leetcode.com/u/EBambi/)) each folder contains my solution without help and the recommended solution I can find online. This way I'm able to learn the best/more efficient way to solve these issues, those solutions can be spotted because of its prefix `bis_` which stands for **B**est **I**nternet's **S**olution.

**e.g.**
```
roman_to_integer/
├── bis_roman_to_integer.py
└── roman_to_integer.py
```
